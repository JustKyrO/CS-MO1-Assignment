<h2> Experience </h2>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI worked at a <i> Wendy's </i> fast food restaurant for about <br> 4 months before quarantine started. It required me to be <br> ServSafe certified, and I had to watch over 6 hours <br> of how to maintain a clean work environment and how <br> to handle the food in a hygienic way. I was also <br> trained in how to work front register, and the correct <br> way to disinfect and clean the eating area.
